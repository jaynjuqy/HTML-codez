        <h1 style="font-family:verdana">WELCOME TO HELL'S KITCHEN</h1>
        <p>Hell's Kitchen is a renowned and appraised kitchen and restaurant across the whole campus.
        It is a place where your taste buds meet long awaited paradise. Hell's Kitchen therefore offers 
        as clearly by one of the many hearty reviews uploaded by our customers, and I quote,<br></p>
        <p style="font-family:courier;">
            <i>"...when I was recommended to your restaurant, I was reluctant<br>
        to actually try it but when i finally got to my senses and did,<br>
        heaven on Earth began..."</i><br>
        </p>
    
        <p>A lot of the reviews had one thing in common...<br>
        <i>"...could you please forward the recipe??..."</i><br>
        and so,being very loyal to our customers,we find it quite right that they should
        have a recipe from our esteemed staff to try at home/DIY it :)<br>
